### Notes

One of the challenges I encountered is the app crash. The application crashed out of nowhere when I was trying to add the YouTube video. And that there is no error popping up, but the app closing without a notice. Currently fixing the error.
Edit: The error turned out to be the issue of play store availability on the emulator.

## Flix Part 1

### User Stories

#### REQUIRED (10pts)
- [x] (10pts) User can view a list of movies (title, poster image, and overview) currently playing in theaters from the Movie Database API.

- [x] (2pts) Views should be responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [x] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [x] (2pts) Display a nice default [placeholder graphic](https://guides.codepath.org/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library#advanced-usage) for each image during loading
- [x] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
Most of the challenges happened while I was trying to incorporate the bonus user stories. One of the challenges was to get the placeholder graphic to work. I was trying to use a nicer placeholder image, which shows a gray background. However, since I was unable to get it up. I defaulted the placeholder to the drawable provided by Android. Another challenge was actually understanding what is required to be done for the last bonus user story. I am still unsure what "full backdrop" in this case means and how it is supposed to look in order to get full points for it. However, I have provided a rating bar with its score out of 5 instead.
